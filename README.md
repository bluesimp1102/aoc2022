Solution for each day will be located in its folder/module. The module `utils` is used for reading and writing the output file for each day. You will see me use this for challenges in this repo.

I started doing this a year later as I just get to know about Advent of Code (AoC) recently and it's been pretty interesting so far with 2023's challenges so I want to look around and try to solve the previous year challenges.

Not every solution is the most optimized one as I don't have much time for it because of the final, the goal here is for me to solve the problems as fast as I can and I will optimize the algorithm when I got the chance to do so.
